Plant Disease Epidemiology at The Pennsylvania State University

We are building a new website for the Esker Lab at the Pennsylvania State University. Our goal is to provide to everyone useful information about our efforts and our desire to share information to the world. We are committed to open communication and science, embrace diversity, and respect different views and opinions. 

Our program focuses on increasing the understanding of how plant pathogens and diseases impact crop productivity at different scales. We apply a wide array of approaches to student the impact of major pests. While our primary focus is on crop species like maize, soybean, small grains which include wheat and barley, as well as forages, we have conducted research and educational programming in the both temperate and tropic agroecoystems.

If you have any questions, comments, or inquires about the program, please reach out directly to Dr. Paul Esker, pde6@psu.edu (pde6 "at" psu.edu).

Thank you and welcome to the site!
